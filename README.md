## Tasks done in the Project

- Propose a possible hardware solution, based on three scenarios
- Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
- Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
- Revise your proposal based on the test results

## Hardware Proposal

### The Scenarios

Three different scenarios have been provided that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

The three scenarios you'll be looking at are:

    Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector
    Scenario 2: Retail Sector
